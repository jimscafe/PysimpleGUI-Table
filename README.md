# PysimpleGUI-Table
A table object using Text boxes as cells.

The table allows scrolling, sparse data, responds to a cell being clicked, a callback can be used to display each cell and modify the cell depending upon the data (e.g. change background color if value is negative etc.

The top row is separate from the data and is  the column headers. The left columns can be fixed so as not to scroll.

A simple example of usage is provided.

I should give credit to the programmer who created the basic table from which this is dervied. This table implemented the scroll bars with the mousewheel. My contribution was to add the above features. The original was a concept I think. However, I have no idea where I obtained the basic code, but would gratefully thank the original author should I ever discover his identity.
